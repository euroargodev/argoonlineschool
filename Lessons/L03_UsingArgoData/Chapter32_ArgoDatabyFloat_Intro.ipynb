It begins with a *R* since it is the Real-Time data and if it begins with an *D* it would be adjusted data, or Delayed Mode data; we will see an example in section [Real-Time and Delayed mode data¶](https://euroargodev.github.io/argoonlineschool/Lessons/L03_UsingArgoData/Chapter34_RTandDM.html). \n",
